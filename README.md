> A continues stream of qoutes for each day.

## Installation

```sheel
npm install qoutes
```

## Example

```javascript
var quotes = require('quotes');
var inspectpoint = require('inspectpoint');

// Stream qoutes since 2013-01-01 from IBM until now and beyond
quotes('IBM', new Date('2013-01-01'))
  .pipe(inspectpoint({colors: true}))
  .pipe(process.stdout);
```

## Documentation

`qoutes` is a standard Readable stream. It pulls qoutes from Yahoo Finance for
a given symbol, since a specified date. When all data from the past is collected
it will begin to do live pulling, so new data will be send to you when available.

```javascript
var qoutes = require('qoutes');
```

### stream = qoutes(symbol, since, [options])

* `symbol` is the company symbol (not name).
* `since` is a `Date` object specifying from when the data stream should start.
* `options` is an object, it can contain the following properties:
  * `timeout` is a number given in milliseconds. Because Yahoo don't support a
    streaming interface `qoutes` performs pulling using HTTP request. When fetching
    data from the past, this will go as fast as you can read it, but once the data
    becomes live there is a delay between each HTTP request. This delay is defined
    by this property. (Default is `43200000` = 12 hour)
  * `interval` is a number given in days. Because data from Yahoo is outputted in
    a now = first past = last order, it can not be stream parsed and piped. Instead
    it is stored internally and then reversed. This means that there will be a high
    memory usage for large amount of data. To prevent this `qoutes` fetches the data
    in small interval. This internal is given by this propery. (Default is `180` = Â½ year)
    **Do not set this to anything less than 5**, this is to prevent getting stocked in
    periodes where the stock market is closed.

```javascript
// !! Very expencive
var stream = quotes('IBM', new Date('2013-01-01'), {
  timeout: 2000,
  interval: 5
});
```

### stream.read()

`qoutes` is a standard Readable stream, and supports all the methods and events
there are to follow. The read data there can also be piped are objects with the
following format:

```javascript
{
  date: Date,
  open: Number,
  high: Number,
  low: Number,
  close: Number,
  volume: Number,
  adjClose: Number
}
```

### stream.close()

To stop the data flow and the HTTP pulling, simply call this method. Note that
the `end` event will be followed by this call.

```javascript
stream.close();
```
